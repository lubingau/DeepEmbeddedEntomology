We present 2 sytems that can respond to our low power problems. The first one is a 1-board system composed of only the zyboz7, on which all the process of detection and AI classification will be done. The second one is a 2-boards system, composed of the zyboz7 to do the detection, and a second board, either the Ultra96v2 or the Kria KV260 to do the AI classification.
